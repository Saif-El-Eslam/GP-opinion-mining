The unlikely patchwork of hedge funds, asset managers, and amateur investors is trying to unseat Grayscale Investments, the steward of the trust, whose management they claim has cost them billions of dollars.Since 2015, GBTC has been marketed as a\u00a0simple way for regular people to invest in bitcoin without having to deal with an exchange, send crypto between wallets, or figure out how to store it safely. The value of GBTC shares is linked to the price of bitcoin: For every new share created, a fraction of a bitcoin is added to a pot, anchoring its value.In a series of adverts targeting the general public, some of which aired on major US TV networks, Grayscale\u00a0described bitcoin as \u201cthe future\u201d and the\u00a0ideal investment for retirees and other investors that\u00a0\u201cdeserve the best.\u201d Now, GBTC shares are owned by hundreds of thousands of amateur investors.\u00a0At the start of 2021, the shares, which had consistently traded at a higher price (sometimes even double) than the underlying bitcoin for years, slumped to\u00a052 percent of the value of bitcoin in mid-December, meaning that for every $1 in bitcoin that shareholders own through the trust, they can only claim back $0.52 by selling their GBTC shares on the market. In aggregate, the discount created a multibillion-dollar hole in investors\u2019 pockets.\u201cInvestors are in limbo,\u201d says Christian Gal\u00edndez Beltr\u00e1n, a shareholder who claims to hold around $200,000 in bitcoin via the trust. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about not being able to redeem the totality of my money.\u201dAnother investor, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from the brokerage at which he works, says he purchased roughly $30,000 in bitcoin through GBTC with the goal of hedging against inflation as he prepares for retirement. Although his financial situation has not been\u00a0too badly damaged, he says the performance of the trust has \u201cill-affected\u201d his marriage; his wife, who \u201cfears the loss is permanent,\u201d has taken to calling him a \u201cbitcoin bozo.\u201dThousands of GBTC shareholders like these have registered their support for the activist campaign, according to David Bailey, founder of BTC Inc and hedge fund UTXO Management, and leader of one strand of the movement.\u201cThat\u2019s what makes this a unique situation,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cThis product is sold on brokerage platforms in individual retirement accounts. This is your mom and dad thinking they are diversifying their portfolio.\u201dWIRED spoke to six GBTC shareholders, all of whom told similar stories. One person said they have the entirety of their savings tied up in GBTC, while another has taken on additional work to ensure he is able to sustain himself into retirement.\u00a0Bailey claims that more than 50 institutions, some of which hold several hundred-million-dollar stakes in GBTC, are also involved in the rebellion to unseat Grayscale, representing a total of at least 20 percent of GBTC shares. He claims to be unable to provide proof, citing investor privacy and legal considerations, but supplied WIRED with web traffic and form submission data that suggests at least 2,000 investors have joined the campaign.Angela WatercutterPeter YeungDhruv MehrotraVauhini VaraMichael Sonnenshein, Grayscale CEO, says his firm is going nowhere. \u201cWe have absolutely no intention of stepping down from our role,\u201d says Sonnenshein. \u201cOur\u00a0trust agreement explicitly states that we would have to voluntarily step down\u2014and our work is not done.\u201dBut the activists are unperturbed. \u201cOur expectation is that, through the pure groundswell of people that want to get out of this thing, pressure is going to be put on,\u201d says Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at asset management firm Valkyrie, another ringleader of the campaign to overthrow Grayscale. \u201cThere are a lot of ways to affect change.\u201d He refused to elaborate on what he meant. McClurg describes this information as \u201csecret sauce.\u201dThe group spearheaded by Bailey, called RedeemGBTC, wants Grayscale to reduce its 2 percent management fee, which it describes as \u201cpredatory,\u201d because it\u2019s calculated against the trust\u2019s bitcoin reserves, not the price of the severely discounted shares. The group also wants Grayscale to allow investors to exchange their shares directly for the underlying bitcoin\u2014in a process known as redemption\u2014as soon as possible.The nature of the trust\u2019s fee structure, lawyers representing Bailey\u2019s hedge fund have\u00a0claimed, creates a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d for Grayscale to maximize the number of shares in the trust and restrict redemptions: They argue that the greater the number of shares in the trust, the larger the pot of bitcoin, which swells the revenue generated by management fees.\u00a0McClurg describes this arrangement as a \u201chostage\u201d situation: Investors cannot exit without absorbing a large markdown on the price of bitcoin.However, the demands mapped out by Bailey and RedeemGBTC are an unhelpful oversimplification of the situation, suggests Grayscale, which claims to be doing everything in its power to do right by its investors.Namely, Grayscale has entered into a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over its campaign to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund, or ETF, which would let investors cash in their shares for the bitcoin in the pot.\u00a0On June 29, 2022, the SEC\u00a0announced it would not grant permission to convert the trust, citing fraud and market manipulation concerns. Grayscale has\u00a0sued the SEC over the decision, which it calls \u201carbitrary and capricious.\u201d The two parties are scheduled to present their respective cases to a judge on March 7 and Grayscale expects a final decision to be reached by the autumn. The firm is bullish about the prospects of an ETF of this kind coming to market: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of\u00a0when, not\u00a0if,\u201d says Sonnenshein.\u00a0Although Grayscale could reduce its fees in the meantime, Sonnenshein argued in a\u00a0recent interview with crypto journalist Laura Shin that the funds are best directed toward the ongoing legal battle with the SEC. Once the trust has been converted into an ETF, Grayscale promises to reduce its fees immediately.There has also been a \u201cmeaningful misunderstanding,\u201d Sonnenshein tells WIRED, among frustrated investors, who say that Grayscale could apply to the SEC for exemption from rules that prevent\u00a0them from cashing out. The only way to apply for exemption, says Sonnenshein, is to pursue conversion to an ETF.Angela WatercutterPeter YeungDhruv MehrotraVauhini VaraBailey\u2019s lawyers have also\u00a0argued that Grayscale could allow investors to cash out without dealing with the SEC at all. But it\u2019s not that simple either, says Sonnenshein, because of a\u00a0cease and desist letter issued by the SEC in 2016 that prevented the trust from issuing new shares and allowing shareholders to cash out simultaneously.The complexity of the securities laws that apply to trusts like GBTC creates opportunity for disagreements of this kind. \u201cIt\u2019s a spider\u2019s web,\u201d says Andrew Parish, a veteran crypto founder with close relationships to parties across the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a mess that can hardly be understood by anyone other than accountants and lawyers.\u201dContenders to take over from Grayscale have emerged from the ranks of the rebellion, including McClurg\u2019s Valkyrie. Bailey also has skin in the game: Not only does his hedge fund hold $2.5 million in GBTC shares, but his companies also have a combined $113,000 stake in Valkyrie. If Valkyrie were to succeed in its bid to take on the management of GBTC, it would absorb hundreds of millions of dollars in annual management fees, and Bailey would profit indirectly.But Bailey also says he holds a stake in DCG, Grayscale\u2019s parent company, that\u2019s greater in value than his Valkyrie position, so he also stands to lose if Grayscale is forced out. \u201cThis started because we were frustrated our fund had lost some money on its [GBTC] investment,\u201d says Bailey, \u201cBut once we started to receive comments from people about how they had been affected, it became something else. [We realized that] people need immediate relief.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0While Sonnenshein says Grayscale is always willing to hear investors out, he has\u00a0reservations about the credibility of the RedeemGBTC campaign, which is run almost exclusively through Bailey\u2019s personal Twitter account and a\u00a0simple website.\u201cWe always appreciate the opportunity to engage with any and all of our investors,\u201d says Sonnenshein. \u201c[But] it\u2019s tough to take seriously a Twitter account as a standalone, as compared to the nearly 1 million investor accounts we have across the US \u2026 Anyone could go to the website and say they have one share or 10 million shares\u2014and there\u2019s no verifying it.\u201dBut RedeemGBTC is not the only group Grayscale has to contend with. In December, investment firm Fir Tree\u00a0filed a lawsuit against Grayscale in an effort to force the firm to hand over information that might assist in an investigation into potential mismanagement and conflicts of interest. The lawsuit asserts that Grayscale\u2019s \u201cshareholder-unfriendly actions\u201d have harmed Fir Tree customers that hold GBTC shares, many of which are pension funds.This was followed in late January by a\u00a0lawsuit filed by asset management firm Osprey Funds claiming Grayscale made \u201cfalse and misleading statements in its advertising and promotion\u201d that gave investors the impression that GBTC\u2019s conversion into an ETF was a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d Osprey also claims Grayscale\u2019s approach to advertising has made it impossible for competitors, including itself, to accrue meaningful market share.Angela WatercutterPeter YeungDhruv MehrotraVauhini VaraLike Valkyrie, Osprey has called on Grayscale to step down as sponsor and put itself forward as a replacement. In an\u00a0open letter, Osprey CEO Greg King promised to cut the management fee by 75 percent, seek immediately to implement a redemption program, and collaborate with regulators instead of pursuing litigation.The Fir Tree and Osprey lawsuits were described by Jennifer Rosenthal, vice president of communications at Grayscale, as \u201cbaseless\u201d and \u201cfrivolous,\u201d respectively. \u201cWe remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is the best long-term product structure for investors, and are 100 percent committed to that endeavor,\u201d she says.As it stands, the various parties are locked in a stalemate; Grayscale says it\u2019s not going anywhere and remains confident in the strength of its case against the SEC, while the activists are scratching their heads over how to remove the firm.In the meantime, the situation threatens to devolve into a mud-slinging contest, says Parish, as Grayscale tries to ride out this difficult period.It is not necessarily in Grayscale\u2019s interest for the conversion to an ETF to take place\u00a0too quickly, he says, because the recent negative press around DCG and its subsidiaries (the lending unit of one subsidiary, Genesis,\u00a0filed for bankruptcy in January) would likely cause investors to run for the exit at the earliest opportunity, taking millions of dollars in management fees with them.\u201cThe entirety of Grayscale\u2019s strategy here is to limit redemptions and then PR, PR, PR. And to fight legal battles on whatever field they have to fight,\u201d claims Parish.Sonnenshein contests the idea that activating redemptions would trigger a customer exodus, arguing that the \u201cregulated, battle-tested\u201d ETF structure will attract an even larger audience and an even greater amount of capital into bitcoin. He also says that converting the trust into an ETF has been the plan from the outset. \u201cThis is something that investors want and deserve,\u201d he says.If the courts were to rule against Grayscale and the company exhausts all remaining legal avenues of appeal, Sonnenshein says it would\u00a0pursue a tender offer whereby a portion of shareholders are bought out of their shares at a price established with \u201cinvestor fairness\u201d in mind.But RedeemGBTC and Fir Tree do not share Grayscale\u2019s conviction in the strength of its case against the SEC, which is described by the pair as \u201cdoomed\u201d and \u201cwasteful,\u201d respectively, and point to the need for an urgent resolution to the situation.\u201cIf we thought Grayscale was going to be successful [in converting GBTC to an ETF], we wouldn\u2019t try to stop it. We just don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen\u2014so something has to be done,\u201d says Bailey.\u00a0Three other shareholders say they believe it is unlikely for an ETF to be approved while Gary Gensler, sitting chairperson of the SEC, remains in charge. (Gensler\u2019s term is due to end in 2026.) The SEC declined to comment.\u201cThey [Grayscale] are going to dig their heels in and fight to the very end, but it\u2019s not going to bode well for them,\u201d says McClurg. \u201cFinancial services is a confidence game; when your clients lose faith, you\u2019ll never get them back. In the long run, I think they\u2019re done.\u201d\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!The out-of-control spread of crowd-control techThe future of weight loss looks like its pastAn inflammatory disease is hiding in plain sightRihanna pioneered a new kind of Super Bowl showBitcoin miners are playing a risky game of chicken\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Explore AI like never before with our new database\u2728 Optimize your home life with our Gear team\u2019s best picks, from robot vacuums to affordable mattresses to smart speakersJoel KhaliliWIRED StaffAndy GreenbergJoel KhaliliVittoria ElliottAndy GreenbergParesh DaveShubham AgarwalMore From WIREDContact\u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Now,\u00a0OnePlus, a Chinese manufacturer known for its speedy, solid smartphones, is throwing its own Android tablet onto the table. The company announced the OnePlus Pad this week, along with the second generation of its\u00a0Buds Pro bluetooth earbuds, and an all new\u00a0mechanical keyboard.The aluminum-bodied tablet looks to be a sleek addition to the often clunky world of Android tablets. Most notable is its 11.6-inch screen with an aspect ratio of 7:5. That\u2019s odd for a tablet; most iPad screens are 4:3, which is the same as a classic television set. When you hold the OnePlus Pad in landscape mode, the tablet\u2019s screen should be a little taller than you might be used to on a tablet.\u00a0There's a 13-megapixel camera on the back of the tablet (and an 8-megapixel selfie cam on the front).Also notable is the matching keyboard that attaches magnetically, and the stylus for pen input. Both are sold separately. OnePlus claims the battery life is good for over 12 hours of continuous video playback; you can watch Seven Samurai three times plus a couple episodes of The Office before recharging.\u00a0It is available in one color (green) and will be available for preorder in April for an undetermined price. Hovering ominously in the background here is the notion that Google is expected to debut its newest Android tablet later this year, possibly in May.Here are some other stories from the world of consumer tech.Last week, Netflix accidentally leaked the news that it will crack down on password sharing. Then it hastily walked that back after a public outcry. But now Netflix has\u00a0officially announced it is implementing rules that prevent people who don\u2019t live in the same home from sharing a single Netflix account. The unlucky first victims of this policy are subscribers in Canada, New Zealand, Spain, and Portugal.In its announcement, Netflix detailed its plans for limiting account sharing. Now, anyone not living in the same household as the account holder will be prompted to transfer their profiles to a new paid account or be cut off. Netflix says the restrictions will roll out more broadly within months. It also said the service would \u201crefine these new features based on member feedback.\u201d As you might imagine, that feedback has been not great.The streaming service has been\u00a0building to this for a while now, testing out these restrictions in countries with a smaller customer base. The crackdown\u00a0hasn\u2019t come for the US yet, but that it will seems about as likely as Netflix canceling one of its shows after a single season. (Which is to say,\u00a0very likely.)Buy-now, pay-later plans are all the rage, allowing customers to pay for stuff in interest-free installments rather than one bank-breaking chunk. Financial services like Klarna and Affirm have become very popular among cash-strapped consumers, who have even used them to buy food and holiday gifts. Of course, they\u2019ve got\u00a0some problems. (Who doesn\u2019t love the idea of not paying full price and then potentially getting wracked by debt months later?)Apple is eager to get in on the BNPL game under its\u00a0own proprietary system, of course. Apple first announced the feature at its\u00a02022 Worldwide Developers Conference, but it has yet to make its way to the public. Recently, Apple expanded its testing of the plan to\u00a0employees at its retail stores, a move that has often preceded other Apple service announcements. That seems to indicate that the broader rollout of its BNPL plan is imminent.Back in the day, all the cool kid criminals used crypto. Blockchain-based currencies like Bitcoin were hailed as an anonymous, untraceable means of payment. Aspiring lawbreakers could use crypto to buy even the darkest of dark web contraband with impunity, their identities shrouded in the mystery guaranteed by their means of payment. Or so many people thought.Turns out, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are in fact entirely traceable. You just have to know where to look. And unfortunately for some crypto-carrying criminals, federal law enforcement officers knew exactly how to track them down.Julian ChokkattuAdrienne SoJaina GreyTim BarberThis week on\u00a0Gadget Lab, WIRED senior writer and author of the book\u00a0Tracers in the Dark Andy Greenberg digs into the cat-and-mouse game that is uncovering crypto cybercrime, and why even the people who depended on the complexity of crypto the most failed to understand the digital trail that it leaves behind.\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!We\u2019re all living under gravity\u2019s rainbowNike\u2019s most popular racing shoe is getting a rebootThe bird flu outbreak has taken an ominous turnThe case for more\u2014and better\u2014sex scenesNew Zealand faces a future of flood and fire\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Explore AI like never before with our new database\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Want the best tools to get healthy?

His crypto-mining company, among the largest in the world, has found itself\u2014like the rest of the industry\u2014in the path of a perfect storm.Over the past year, the sector has been battered by a slump in the price of bitcoin, combined with a\u00a0spike in the cost of energy\u00a0and an increase in mining difficulty\u2014a reflection of the amount of computing power directed at the bitcoin network, which dictates the proportion of coins miners are able to win.\u00a0At the height of the 2021 boom, profit margins in the mining business rose as high as 90 percent, says Thiel. But now, they have \u201ctotally collapsed.\u201d If the price of bitcoin does not rally, he says, there will be \u201ca lot more pain,\u201d and firms that are only marginally profitable today will find themselves \u201cvery underwater.\u201d\u00a0As they scramble to cut costs, miners are playing a high-stakes game of chicken. In spring 2024, the halving, a\u00a0mechanism baked into the bitcoin system that periodically cuts the number of coins awarded in half, will slash mining profits. The goal for miners is to ensure they are in a strong enough financial position to survive the fall in profits longer than anyone else; as miners give in and drop from the network, the share of coins won by the rest will increase.\u00a0\u201cAny miners that are struggling now will not be able to survive the halving,\u201d says Jeff Burkey, VP of business development at Foundry, which operates its own mining facilities, a large-scale mining pool, and a marketplace for mining hardware. The dynamic will create a rush among miners to get their houses in order, he explains.Miners will look to eke out additional profit margin wherever they can, whether by deploying superior hardware and cooling techniques, developing software to closely monitor the performance of machines, relocating to territories with cheaper power, or renegotiating the terms of their loans.Others, like Geosyn Mining, are aiming at vertical integration\u2014all the way down to the energy powering the facilities. The company, says CEO Caleb Ward, wants to construct its own solar farm to power its machines, thereby eliminating a major cost. \u201cWe need to be more thoughtful as an industry about how we protect against risk,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about shooting for the moon.\u201dMeanwhile, the miners whose financial predicaments prevent them from fine-tuning their operations are playing a dangerous waiting game, gambling on an increase in the price of bitcoin that may never come.\u201cThe beauty of halving cycles is that the industry [is forced] to become more efficient\u2014a lot of weaker players will have to exit the business,\u201d says Jeff Lucas, CFO of mining company Bitfarms, which has worked to restructure its finances in the downturn. \u201cThe devil is in the details.\u201dAlready on the back foot, mining companies are beginning to fold. Compute North, which owned multiple large-scale mining facilities,\u00a0filed for bankruptcy in September, and Core Scientific, a publicly traded miner,\u00a0did the same in December. Others are having to maneuver. Argo Blockchain, also a public company, was forced to\u00a0sell off mining equipment and its\u00a0state-of-the-art mining center, while Stronghold Digital Mining has negotiated a\u00a0debt repayment holiday. Neither company responded to interview requests.Angela WatercutterPeter YeungDhruv MehrotraVauhini VaraA combination of \u201cimmaturity, poor planning, and greed\u201d has led miners to the brink of collapse, says Phil Harvey, CEO of Sabre56, a crypto-mining consultancy firm that also operates its own facilities. While the market was hot, companies took on large amounts of debt at high interest rates (10-20 percent) to finance expansion, says Harvey, and now the value of the coins they earn is insufficient to cover the costs of repayments.Historically, a steep rise in the price of bitcoin, triggered by a buying frenzy, has been followed by a sharp fall and then a gradual recovery. Although there is no guarantee this pattern will repeat, the process is widely described as the bitcoin cycle. The fatal mistake, says Jaime Leverton, CEO of mining company Hut 8, was to imagine that that 2021 was different\u2014that the industry was in a \u201csupercycle\u201d that was going to \u201cbreak prior cycles\u201d and extend the hot streak. A lot of people bought into this idea, she explains, and so were caught off-guard when the market tanked.In an effort to strengthen its own position, Hut 8 is in the process of\u00a0merging with US Bitcoin, another mining firm. The goal, says Leverton, is to minimize risks associated with the volatility of bitcoin by diversifying both revenue streams and the regions in which the business operates.Whereas Hut 8 only has facilities in Canada and mines exclusively for itself, US Bitcoin runs mines across the US and hosts mining hardware for third-party customers alongside other auxiliary services. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be dynamic,\u201d says Mike Ho, cofounder of US Bitcoin. \u201cThere is an optimal strategy, depending on the price of bitcoin. It\u2019s about knowing how to navigate through the cycle at different stages.\u201dRecognizing the trajectory of the market, other companies have sought to eliminate outstanding debt as rapidly as possible. In the summer of 2021, Bitfarms had $165 million of debt on its books, at interest rates between 16 and 18 percent. Lucas says it may seem \u201cabsurd\u201d to stomach these exorbitant rates, but it \u201cmade sense\u201d because the cost of debt was eclipsed by the revenue generated by mining activity\u2014at least until it wasn\u2019t.\u00a0\u201cAs revenues came down dramatically with the price of bitcoin, there was still a high debt to pay for,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that put a squeeze on a lot of companies.\u201d\u00a0In June 2022, Bitfarms began to sell down the bitcoin in its treasury to eliminate its debt. Earlier this month, the firm also managed to\u00a0negotiate down a $21 million debt to bankrupt crypto lender BlockFi that was instead paid off in a single $7.75 million cash payment. The company\u2019s approach to slashing debt, coupled with a focus on maximizing the efficiency of its mining rigs, says Lucas, will put Bitfarms in good stead to weather the remainder of the crypto winter.The scramble among miners to balance the books has attracted the attention of other market participants hoping to increase their market share at a reduced price. Investment firm Galaxy Digital has long been eager to expand its bitcoin-mining operations. Sensing an opportunity, the company\u00a0swooped in to grab Argo\u2019s flagship Helios mine in December, spending $65 million for a facility\u00a0reported to have cost at least $1.5 billion to build.Mergers, acquisitions, and collapses will continue to be a theme, says Alex Mologoko, analyst at blockchain intelligence company Elementus, until \u201call economically unsustainable mining operations are weeded out.\u201d\ud83d\udce9 The latest on tech, science, and more: Get our newsletters!Keanu will never surrender to the machinesThe Ohio train derailment made a TikTok stormIt\u2019s always sunny inside a generative AI conferenceThe secret to Bruce Lee\u2019s superhuman one-inch punchGermany raises red flags about Palantir\u2019s data dragnet\ud83d\udc41\ufe0f Explore AI like never before with our new database\ud83d\udcbb Upgrade your work game with our Gear team\u2019s favorite laptops, keyboards, typing alternatives, and noise-canceling headphonesChris Stokel-WalkerAmanda HooverVarsha BansalVauhini VaraWill KnightAarian MarshallDavid NieldVirginia ValenzuelaMore From WIREDContact\u00a9 2023 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "text": "El Salvador, which has already lost tens of millions of taxpayer dollars on its authoritarian millennial president\u2019s beleaguered effort to embrace cryptocurrencies, now says it plans to open a \u201cbitcoin embassy\u201d in Texas. The Central American country\u2019s continued commitment to bitcoin comes despite last year\u2019s crypto winter and surveys showing the overwhelming majority of its citizens have simply never used it. Milena Mayorga, the country\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. says she discussed the embassy idea with Texas Deputy Secretary of State Joe Esparza. Though it\u2019s unclear what, if any, meaningful function a bitcoin embassy serves or what its physical presence would look like, Mayorga believes the agreement could aid \u201cexpansion of commercial and economic exchange projects.\u201d\u201cThe state of Texas, our new ally,\u201d Mayorga wrote.This actually isn\u2019t El Salvador\u2019s first attempt at a bitcoin embassy. Late last year, the country signed a memorandum of understanding with the Swiss city Lugano advertised as aiming to support bitcoin adoption in both regions and enhance cooperation in education and research. As part of that agreement, El Salvador plans to set up a \u201cbitcoin office\u201d where it will advocate for bitcoin in the city and Europe more generally. Lugano moved to make cryptocurrency Tether a \u201cde facto\u201d legal tender in March 2022, around a year after El Salvdor became the first country in the world to officially recognize bitcoin as legal currency.While most other cities and local lawmakers boarding the crypto hype train cooled their tone following last year\u2019s brutal crypto crash, El Salvador has doubled down. Last summer, following months of plummeting cryptocurrency prices, president Nayib Bukele said El Salvador \u201cbought the dip!\u201d and invested 500 more coins at an average price of $30,744. Bukele reiterated his commitment months later, proclaiming the country would buy one new bitcoin every day for the foreseeable future. At the time of that announcement, the price of bitcoin was down 73% from the same time a year prior, sinking El Salvador\u2019s holdings  with it.Keep it light and stay secure.This combination wall light and security camera from eufy offers nightvision, 2K picture, and over 3 weeks of local video storage with no hidden fee. Get it for $50 off on Amazon with code: WSWLCE50US.All of that investment has cost the country tens of millions. In November, according to a Bloomberg analysis the country\u2019s 2,381 total bitcoins were reportedly worth just $41.5 million, down 60% from the roughly $105 million they were worth when the government purchased them in 2021. Bitcoin\u2019s abysmal performance may have also played a role in credit agency Fitch\u2019s decision to downgrade El Salvador\u2019s credit debt rating from CCC to CC. That\u2019s Fitch\u2019s fourth worst credit rating, seven ticks below the AAA gold standard.El Salvador\u2019s public embrace of the technology may succeed in drawing attention to it\u00a0from outside investors, but it\u2019s so far done little to actually drive up the technology\u2019s use within the country. A March 2022 survey conducted by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of El Salvador found an overwhelming 86% of businesses had never completed a transaction using bitcoin. World Bank data from 2020, meanwhile, found that only around half (55%) of Salvadorians even have access to the internet. ",

        "text": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - Big investors are dipping their toes into crypto waters again after a bumper month for bitcoin.Digital asset investment products, often favored by institutional investors, saw inflows of over $117 million last week, the biggest weekly increase since last July, according to data from asset manager CoinShares.Bitcoin was far and away the biggest draw, with funds tracking it responsible for $116 million of that. Crypto funds' total assets under management have risen to $28 billion, up 43% from lows plumbed in November as the collapse of the FTX exchange sent shockwaves through the industry.\"For the most part, people are more confident than they were a month ago,\" said Joseph Edwards, investment adviser at Enigma Securities.Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, has soared nearly 40% in January, closing in on its best monthly performance since October 2021 and its second-best January in the past 10 years.The rally, combined with a possibly brightening macro picture, has some investors hoping the long crypto winter might finally be verging on spring. Many investors expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike its benchmark rates by 0.25% this week - the smallest rise since their tightening cycle began last year.View 2 more stories \"If peak inflation is indeed behind us for now, then long-term interest rates may move lower as we approach the end of the inflation-focused rate-hiking cycle,\" analysts at Fidelity Digital Assets wrote.\"This could signal positive momentum on the macro front for assets such as bitcoin.\"Activity in the options market indicated traders were rushing to place bets just after the Fed meet, a sign of the importance the market is placing on it, crypto liquidity provider B2C2 said.Crypto trading volumes are also rising, according to CoinShares, with average weekly volumes up 11%, indicating traders are returning after months of dampened activity.Still, crypto's not out of the woods by a long stretch, and the Fed could still spoil the party if they take a more hawkish tone this week.Crypto data platform Coinglass's bitcoin Fear & Greed index - where 0 indicates extreme fear and 100 extreme greed - is hovering at 61, the highest level since mid-November 2021, just after bitcoin began retreating from its peak.\"We might see a drop off next week or two, how deep that drop goes is questionable,\" Edwards said.Nonetheless, there are also other signs that the end of the bear market might be nigh, according to analysts at exchange Bitfinex. They said shorter-term investors were selling their bitcoin at a profit, while longer-term \"HODlers\" were still sticking with their coin and not contributing to selling pressure.\"The realised profit and loss for the entire market has been recorded as positive in January 2023 for the first time since April 2022, a continuation of this trend would signal the final stages of a bear market,\" they said.Additionally, bitcoin's \"dominance\" or share of the total crypto market has hovered around 41% this month, levels not seen since last July. Analysts at Citi said this mimicked a similar jump in bitcoin dominance in April 2019, when a bitcoin rally marked a crypto market bottom.Other market watchers said stocks, another relatively risky asset class, would likely drive bitcoin prices in the next week, particularly the performance of interest rate-sensitive tech stocks.Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq (.IXIC) is at 0.94, the highest since May 2022, where a measure of 1 indicates the two are moving in lock-step.Late in November, bitcoin broke its bonds with stocks and traded with a negative correlation of 0.7.\"It's possible that bitcoin could reach the next resistance level of $25,200 in the coming weeks,\" said Rachel Lin, CEO of exchange Synfutures. \"Even if bitcoin ends up down again, there is a decent chance it will achieve a higher low on the larger timeframe.\"Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

The two men built Berkshire into one of the world's most-valuable corporations by acquiring businesses such as Geico and See's Candies, and purchasing large stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express, and other public companies.Munger is a Daily Journal director, and oversees the newspaper publisher and legal-software seller's investment portfolio. He dismissed the possibility that he might be wrong about the likes of bitcoin, ether, and dogecoin.\"I think the people that oppose my position are idiots,\" he said.Munger, who counts Costco and Tesla-rival BYD among his proudest investments, certainly didn't shy away from laying into crypto.\"It's not even slightly stupid, it's massively stupid,\" he said. \"It's worthless, it's no good, it's crazy, it'll do nothing but harm, and it's antisocial to allow it.\"\"It's just unspeakable, it's an absolute horror, and I'm ashamed of my country that so many people believe in this kind of crap and that the government allows it to exist,\" he continued. \"It is totally, absolutely, crazy-stupid gambling with enormous house odds for the people on the other side.\"Unsurprisingly, Munger advised completely avoiding crypto and the people promoting it. He also underlined the critical role that fiat currencies have played in the development of modern human civilization. He ridiculed the idea of ditching national currencies with crypto, arguing it was as futile as trying to replace countries' air.Munger denounced the cryptocurrency industry as speculative, unregulated, and predatory earlier this month, and urged the US government to ban it completely. He's previously compared crypto to \"rat poison,\" a \"venereal disease,\" and an \"open sewer,\" and said he\u00a0wouldn't want anyone involved with it to marry into his family.Read more: We put 7 burning questions to top economist David Rosenberg.

        "text": "Jump to\nAfter a dismal outing last year, bitcoin has skyrocketed more than 40% to start the new year. But John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas McCombs School of Business, thinks there's something suspicious going on, according to Fortune.He had a similar inkling of foul play in 2017, when he and a colleague noticed that a single bitcoin \"whale\" seemed to drive the token's price and distort trading.\u00a0In 2018, Griffin and Amin Shams published a 118-page report that detailed their proof of bitcoin market manipulation by a single entity. Two years later, the report was picked up by the peer-reviewed Journal of Finance.Today, he sees parallels.\"It's very suspicious,\" Griffin told Fortune. \"The same mechanism we saw in 2017 could be at play now in the still unreal bitcoin market.\"He explained that a token manipulator would want to set a floor price for their asset, which seems to be the case now for bitcoin, which typically sees high volatility rather than stability.\"In a period of highly negative sentiment, we've seen suspiciously solid floors under bitcoin,\" he said.Griffin maintained that the sheer size of the crypto market and the amount of data has made definitive proof elusive. Not only that, but he said bad actors are sophisticated enough to hide their identities.\u00a0Still, one finding from Griffin's research five years ago was that sizable bitcoin purchases happened when the token reached certain thresholds.\u00a0\"We saw far more purchases at those benchmarks,\" Griffin said. \"The whale kept establishing price floors, and those floors kept rising. It wasn't a club. It was one entity. But when the whale held the price at the thresholds, that made it look as if bitcoin was safe at those floors. That made it look safe for funds and small customers to buy bitcoin, driving the price still higher.\"During bitcoin's latest run, it's peculiar how reliably bitcoin bounced above $16,000 seemingly the moment it breached that level, he said. That dynamic was evident when Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX was crashing.In a five-day stretch in November, bitcoin plunged 25% to $15,900. Then, according to Fortune calculations, the token traded between $16,000 to $18,000 every single day leading up to January 11 except for one.\u00a0\u00a0For bitcoin to exhibit that degree of stability is unusual. FTX marked one of the largest collapses in crypto and financial history, yet the price of the world's largest token saw some of the smallest swings ever.\u00a0Today, Griffin believes that bitcoin remains \"highly vulnerable to manipulation,\" per Fortune.\"We don't have concrete analysis this time,\" he added. \"The truth may emerge in specific stories, if there is collusion.\"Check out: Personal Finance Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchangesCheck out: Personal Finance Insider's picks for best cryptocurrency exchanges\n                          Read next\n                        IndicesCommoditiesCurrenciesStocks",

The crypto is currently trading flat at $23,031 on Wednesday, according to Messari.Ark detailed the token's outlook in a new report, which predicted that bitcoin could \"scale into a multi-trillion dollar market\" by the end of the decade. Even the famed money manager's bear case for bitcoin is a price target of $258,500 in the next seven years, a 1,022% increase from the crypto's current price.The firm maintained that bitcoin's fundamentals are sound despite a turbulent 2022. To support its bold calls, the report pointed to continued institutional adoption, higher hash rates, and long-term holder supply of bitcoin.\u00a0The bullish estimates come amid a severe and lengthy crypto market rut. Bitcoin is down 65% from its all-time high in November 2021, with the industry's total market value off over 64% from its peak.Crypto markets took hits in the past year on inflation concerns, leaving traders with little risk appetite, along with a series of industry bankruptcies, which caused widespread contagion.

Suing the regulator was one of the most important decisions he had made as CEO, and was \"one that I did not, and we as a team, did not take lightly,\" he said, adding that he is confident the court will rule in the firm's favor.The SEC rejected Grayscale\u2019s application to covert its flagship Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC.PK) (GBTC) into an ETF in June, arguing that the proposal did not meet standards designed to prevent fraudulent practices and protect investors.View 2 more stories Grayscale sued the SEC almost immediately after its proposal was denied, claiming that the regulator was acting arbitrarily in rejecting applications for spot bitcoin ETFs when it had previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs.The case is being heard in front of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. If either party were to appeal the ruling, the case would either go to the U.S. Supreme Court or an en banc panel review. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled to occur March 7 and Grayscale expects a final ruling on the case in the fall, said Sonnenshein.The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has $14.5 billion assets under management, according to Grayscale\u2019s website. The GBTC discount to bitcoin is hovering around 41%, coming under pressure after crypto exchange FTX collapsed and crypto lender Genesis suspended withdrawals.There are further concerns about contagion. Genesis and Grayscale are both owned by venture capital Digital Currency Group (DCG), and questions as to whether DCG would have to sell its GBTC holdings have also weighed on the discount.Genesis\u2019 crypto lending unit filed for bankruptcy on Jan. 19.Grayscale had no operational reliance on DCG or Genesis, and was unaffected by the bankruptcy, Sonnenshein said. Still, Genesis owned about 5% of total GBTC shares outstanding, according to a person familiar with the matter. Genesis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u201cGrayscale is a standalone entity with its own leadership, governance, budgets, policies and procedures, and the assets underpinning the Grayscale family of products belong to its respective shareholders,\u201d Sonnenshein said.If its legal challenge to the SEC was unsuccessful, Grayscale would explore options to return a portion of GBTC\u2019s capital to shareholders, Sonnenshein told investors in a letter in December.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world\u2019s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.
